# ItemSwapper Resource Packs Documentation

This file provides an overview of how ItemSwapper resource packs are structured and how they work. ItemSwapper is a mod that allows you to quickly switch between items from your inventory and shulker boxes, based on the held item. You can create your own resource packs or use existing ones to group together items from vanilla and mods.

ItemSwapper resource packs are composed of several components that define how the items are grouped and displayed. These components are:

- **Palettes**: Items are grouped into palettes based on only their item id. You can define your own palettes to group modded items together or create your own custom palettes for vanilla items.
- **Lists**: These are collections of items that share some common properties or characteristics. They get matched by their item id, but differentiated by NBT data on them.
- **Palette Modifications**: Allows you to modify the entries of a palette. You can add or remove items. This is useful for adding items from mods that are not in the default palettes.
- **List Modifications**: These are similar to palette modifications, but they allow you to modify the entries of a list.
- **Links**: Allows you to customize how palettes and lists are linked together. You can use this to create custom palettes that behave like a kind of "super palette" that links to multiple palettes and lists.
- **Language Files**: All the text that is displayed in the game is stored in language files. You can use this to make your resource pack compatible with other languages.
- **Main Menu**: This is an optional file that allows you to create an always visible main menu entry that allows you to quickly switch between palettes and lists.

Each of these components has its own documentation file that explains how to use them in detail. You can find them in the links below:

- [Palettes Documentation](2.%20Palettes.md)
- [Lists Documentation](3.%20Lists.md)
- [Palette Modifications Documentation](4.%20Palette%20Modifications.md)
- [List Modifications Documentation](5.%20List%20Modifications.md)
- [Links Documentation](6.%20Links.md)
- [Language Files Documentation](7.%20Language%20Files.md)
- [Main Menu Documentation](8.%20Main%20Menu.md)

If you are using an older version of ItemSwapper or want to convert an old resource pack to the new format, you can find the documentation for the old pack format here(old packs are still loaded by ItemSwapper, but they are not compatible with the new features):

- [Old Pack Format Documentation](9.%20Old%20Pack%20Format.md)

ItemSwapper resource packs are stored in the `resourcepacks` folder of your Minecraft installation. The JSON files that define the components of your resource pack are located under `assets/itemswapper/itemgroups/v2`. You can organize them in subfolders if you want.

We hope this documentation helps you create your own ItemSwapper resource packs or modify existing ones. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us on our Discord server or GitHub page. Thank you for using ItemSwapper!
