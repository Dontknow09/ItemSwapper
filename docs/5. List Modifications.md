# List Modifications

List Modification files define how to modify existing lists in the game. The main use case for this is to add items from mods that are not in the default lists.

## File Format

The file is a JSON object with the following keys:

- `type`: (string) Required. Must be set to "listModification".
- `target`: (string) Required. A resource location string for the target list to modify. Invalid lists will be ignored.
- `addItems`: (array) Optional. An array of items to be added to the target list. Items can be specified as a simple string (resource location).
- `removeItems`: (array) Optional. An array of items to be removed from the target list. Items can be specified as a simple string (resource location).

### Example JSON

```json
{
  "type": "listModification",
  "target": "modid:existing_list",
  "addItems": [
    "minecraft:emerald",
    "minecraft:diamond"
  ],
  "removeItems": [
    "minecraft:iron_pickaxe",
    "minecraft:golden_pickaxe"
  ]
}
```

In this example, a list modification is defined with a target list, a list of items to add, and a list of items to remove.
