# Old Pack Format Documentation

This is a markdown documentation for the old Itemswapper resource pack format. These packs can still be loaded, but can not use the new features. The format consists of four folders inside the ``assets/itemswapper/itemgroups`` folder:

- ``list``: This folder contains json files that define groups of items as lists, comparing them by their nbt data. For example, you can create a list of all swords. Each sword inside the inventory will then be shown(de-duplicated using their NBT). Each json file should have a unique name and an array of items as its value. Example to list all potions:

```json
[
    "minecraft:potion",
    "minecraft:splash_potion",
    "minecraft:lingering_potion"
]
```

- ``wheel_primary``: This folder contains the item palettes that will have priority when pressing the hotkey. Each palette is a json file with a unique name and an array of items as its value. Palette items are matched only by their item id, ignoring NBT. Example of oak wood types:

```json
[
    "minecraft:oak_log",
    "minecraft:oak_wood",
    "minecraft:stripped_oak_log",
    "minecraft:stripped_oak_wood",
    "minecraft:oak_planks",
    "minecraft:oak_stairs",
    "minecraft:oak_slab",
    "minecraft:oak_fence",
    "minecraft:oak_fence_gate",
    "minecraft:oak_door",
    "minecraft:oak_trapdoor",
    "minecraft:oak_pressure_plate",
    "minecraft:oak_button",
    "minecraft:oak_sign"
]
```

- ``wheel_secondary``: This folder contains the item palettes that will be automatically linked up, when they contain an item that a primary palette has. Each palette is a json file with a unique name and an array of items as its value. The items in the palette should match one of the lists defined in the ``wheel_primary`` folder. Example of all doors, linking up the oak door from the primary palette example:

```json
[
    "minecraft:oak_door",
    "minecraft:spruce_door",
    "minecraft:birch_door",
    "minecraft:jungle_door",
    "minecraft:acacia_door",
    "minecraft:dark_oak_door",
    "minecraft:mangrove_door",
    "minecraft:crimson_door",
    "minecraft:warped_door"
]
```

- ``wheel_combined``: This folder contains json files that define pairs of palettes that will be forcefully linked together, regardless of whether they contain matching items or not. Each json file should have a unique name and an array with arrays of items as its value, representing the palettes to be linked. Example of linking 8 wool colors with 8 different wool colors:

```json
[
    [
        "minecraft:white_wool",
        "minecraft:orange_wool",
        "minecraft:magenta_wool",
        "minecraft:light_blue_wool",
        "minecraft:yellow_wool",
        "minecraft:lime_wool",
        "minecraft:pink_wool",
        "minecraft:gray_wool",
        "minecraft:light_gray_wool",
        "minecraft:cyan_wool",
        "minecraft:purple_wool",
        "minecraft:blue_wool",
        "minecraft:brown_wool",
        "minecraft:green_wool",
        "minecraft:red_wool",
        "minecraft:black_wool"
    ],
    [
        "minecraft:white_carpet",
        "minecraft:orange_carpet",
        "minecraft:magenta_carpet",
        "minecraft:light_blue_carpet",
        "minecraft:yellow_carpet",
        "minecraft:lime_carpet",
        "minecraft:pink_carpet",
        "minecraft:gray_carpet",
        "minecraft:light_gray_carpet",
        "minecraft:cyan_carpet",
        "minecraft:purple_carpet",
        "minecraft:blue_carpet",
        "minecraft:brown_carpet",
        "minecraft:green_carpet",
        "minecraft:red_carpet",
        "minecraft:black_carpet"
    ]
]
```
