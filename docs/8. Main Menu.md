# Main Menu

The Main Menu is an optional file located in the ``assets/itemswapper/itemgroups/v2`` resource pack folder with the name "main.json". If loaded, this pack will always be shown and linked on the right side of the palettes. The goal of this palette is to act as a "hub" to get to all the other commonly used palettes quickly. It is highly recommended to have `disableAutoLink` turned on, and to use the `actAsLink` setting for all items. This palette is otherwise identical to a normal palette, and more sub-palettes with the same functionality can be created(but only this one will be permanently visible on the sidebar).

## Example Main Menu

Below is an example of a main menu palette based on the default resource pack:

```json
{
  "type": "palette",
  "priority": 100,
  "displayName": "text.itemswapper.directory.title",
  "disableAutoLink": true,
  "icon": "minecraft:book",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "minecraft:magma_block",
      "name": "text.itemswapper.directory.nether",
      "link": "itemswapper:v2/the_nether/netherterrain",
      "actAsLink": true
    },
    ...
  ],
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "type": "link",
      "target": "itemswapper:v2/technical/directory_technical"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

In this example, a custom main menu palette is defined with various items acting as links to other palettes.
